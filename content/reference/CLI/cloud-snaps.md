## Overview of cloud backups

This document outlines how to back-up _PX_ volumes to different cloud providers' object storage, including any S3-compatible object storage. To restore a specific backup, the user can restore the volume from that point in time.

_Portworx_ helps administrators running persistent container workloads, on-prem or in the cloud, to safely backup their mission-critical database volumes to any supported cloud storage. Next, they can restore them on-demand. This way, _PX_ enables a **seamless DR integration** for all the important business application data.

### Supported cloud providers

_Portworx PX-Enterprise_ supports the following cloud providers:

1.  Amazon S3 and any S3-compatible Object Storage
2.  Azure Blob Storage
3.  Google Cloud Storage

## Performing cloud backups of a PX volume

_PX_ volumes can be backed up to cloud via `pxctl cloudsnap`. If you run this command with the `--help` flag, it shows the list of available operations for the **full lifecycle management** of your cloud backups:

```text
pxctl cloudsnap --help
```

```output
Backup and restore snapshots to/from cloud

Usage:
  pxctl cloudsnap [flags]
  pxctl cloudsnap [command]

Aliases:
  cloudsnap, cs

Available Commands:
  backup       Backup a snapshot to cloud
  backup-group Backup a group of snapshot for a given group id or labels to cloud
  catalog      Display catalog for the backup in cloud
  delete       Delete a cloudsnap from the objectstore. This is not reversible.
  history      Show history of cloudsnap operations
  list         List snapshot in cloud
  restore      Restore volume to a cloud snapshot
  schedules    Manage schedules for cloud-snaps
  status       Report status of active backups/restores
  stop         stop an active backup/restore

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for cloudsnap
```

### Set the required cloud credentials

For this, we will use `pxctl credentials create` command. Note that the cloud credentials are stored in an external secret store. Hence, before you use the command to create credentials, ensure that you have [configured a secret provider of your choice](/key-management).

To see the list of available command line options, type:

```text
pxctl credentials create --help
```

```output
Create a credential for cloud providers

Usage:
  pxctl credentials create [flags]

Aliases:
  create, c

Examples:
/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl cred create [flags] <name>

Flags:
      --s3-disable-ssl
      --provider string                Cloud provider type [s3, azure, google]
      --s3-access-key string
      --s3-secret-key string
      --s3-region string
      --bucket string                  Optional pre-created bucket name
      --azure-account-name string
      --azure-account-key string
      --google-project-id string
      --google-json-key-file string
      --encryption-passphrase string   Passphrase to be used for encrypting data in the cloudsnaps
      --s3-endpoint strings            Endpoint of the S3 servers, in comma separated host:port format
  -h, --help                           help for create

Global Flags:
      --ca string        path to root certificate for ssl usage
      --cert string      path to client certificate for ssl usage
      --color            output with color coding
      --config string    config file (default is $HOME/.pxctl.yaml)
      --context string   context name that overrides the current auth context
  -j, --json             output in json
      --key string       path to client key for ssl usage
      --raw              raw CLI output for instrumentation
      --ssl              ssl enabled for portworx
```

#### Azure

Here's how you can create the credentials for _Azure_:

```text
pxctl credentials create --provider azure --azure-account-name portworxtest --azure-account-key zbJSSpOOWENBGHSY12ZLERJJV my-azure-cred
```

#### AWS

If you are using _AWS_, _Portworx_ creates a bucket (`ID` same as the cluster `UUID`) to upload cloudsnaps by default. Starting with _Portworx_ version 1.5.0, users can upload to a pre-created bucket. Thus, the _AWS_ credentials provided to _Portworx_ should either:

*   have the capability to create a bucket or
*   the bucket provided to _Portworx_ at a minimum must have the permissions mentioned below.

If you prefer that a user-specified bucket be used for cloudsnaps, specify the bucket id with the `--bucket` option while creating the credentials.

##### With a user specified bucket (applicable only from 1.5.0 onwards)

```text
pxctl credentials create --provider s3  --s3-access-key AKIAJ7CDD7XGRWVZ7A --s3-secret-key mbJKlOWER4512ONMlwSzXHYA --s3-region us-east-1 --s3-endpoint s3.amazonaws.com --bucket bucket-id my-s3-cred
```

The user created/specified bucket at a minimum must have the following permissions:

```text
{
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
			{
				"Sid": "VisualEditor0",
				"Effect": "Allow",
				"Action": [
					"s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
					"s3:GetBucketLocation"
				],
				"Resource": "*"
			},
			{
				"Sid": "VisualEditor1",
				"Effect": "Allow",
				"Action": "s3:*",
				"Resource": [
					"arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>",
					"arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name/*"
				]
			}
		]
 }
```

{{<info>}}
Note: Replace `<bucket-name>` with name of your user-provided bucket.
{{</info>}}


##### Without a user specified bucket

```text
pxctl credentials create --provider s3  --s3-access-key AKIAJ7CDD7XGRWVZ7A --s3-secret-key mbJKlOWER4512ONMlwSzXHYA --s3-region us-east-1 --s3-endpoint s3.amazonaws.com my-s3-cred
```

#### Google Cloud

Here's how you can create the credentials for _Google Cloud_:

```text
pxctl credentials create --provider google --google-project-id px-test --google-json-key-file px-test.json my-google-cred
```

#### Configure credentials

`pxctl credentials create` enables the user to configure the credentials for each supported cloud provider.

An additional encryption key can also be provided for each credential. If provided, all the data being backed up to the cloud will be encrypted using this key. The same key needs to be provided when configuring the credentials for restore. This way, _PX_ will be able to decrypt the data successfully.

These credentials can only be created once and cannot be modified. In order to maintain security, once configured, the secret parts of the credentials will not be displayed.

### List the credentials to verify

Use `pxctl credentials list` to verify the credentials supplied as follows:

```text
pxctl credentials list
```

```output
S3 Credentials
UUID						NAME		REGION			ENDPOINT						ACCESS KEY			SSL ENABLED		ENCRYPTION		BUCKET		WRITE THROUGHPUT (KBPS)
af563a4d-afd7-48df-90f7-8e8f9414ff77		my-s3-cred	us-east-1		70.0.99.121:9010,70.0.99.122:9010,70.0.99.123:9010	AB6R80F3SY0VW9NS6HYQ		false			false			<nil>		1979

1672e1c9-c513-44db-b8b5-b59e3d35a3a2		my-azure-cred		pwx-test		false			<nil>		724
```

`pxctl credentials list` only displays non-secret values of the credentials. Secrets are neither stored locally nor displayed. The credentials will be stored as part of the secret endpoint given to _PX_ for persisting authentication across reboots.

For more information, run:

```text
pxctl secrets help
```

```output

Use "pxctl secrets [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

You can find more details by checking out the [Credentials](/reference/cli/credentials) page.

### Perform cloud backups of single volumes

The actual backup of the _PX_ Volume is done via the `pxctl cloudsnap backup`.

To get more details, run it with the `--help` flag:

```text
pxctl cloudsnap backup --help
```

```output
NAME:
   pxctl cloudsnap backup - Backup a snapshot to cloud

USAGE:
   pxctl cloudsnap backup [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --volume value, -v value       source volume
   --full, -f                     force a full backup
   --cred-id value, --cr value    Cloud credentials ID to be used for the backup

```

As an example, to backup a volume named `volume1`, you would use something like:

```text
pxctl cloudsnap backup volume1 --cred-id 82998914-5245-4739-a218-3b0b06160332

```

Here are a few things to consider about this command:

* it is used to backup a single volume to the cloud provider of your choice using the specified credentials.
* it decides whether to take a full or an incremental backup depending on the existing backups for the volume, as follows:
 * the first backup uploaded to the cloud is always a full backup.
 * after that, subsequent backups are incremental.
 * after 6 incremental backups, every 7th backup is a full backup.
* users can force a full backup any time by giving the `--full` flag.
* if only one credential is configured on the cluster, then the `cred-id` option may be skipped.

Next, we’re going to focus on the steps to perform a successful cloud backup:

* List all the available volumes to choose the volume to backup:

 ```text
 pxctl volume list
 ```

 ```output
 ID			NAME	SIZE	HA	SHARED	ENCRYPTED	IO_PRIORITY	SCALE	STATUS
 56706279008755778	NewVol	4 GiB	1	no	no		LOW		1	up - attached on 70.0.9.73
 980081626967128253	evol	2 GiB	1	no	no		LOW		1	up - detached
 ```

* List the configured credentials:

 ```text
 pxctl cloudsnap credentials list
 ```

 ```output
 Azure Credentials
 UUID						ACCOUNT NAME		ENCRYPTION
 ef092623-f9ba-4697-aeb5-0d5d6d9b5742		portworxtest		false
 ```

* Login to the secrets database to authenticate _Portworx_ with the credentials:

 ```text
 pxctl secrets kvdb login
 ```

 ```output
 Successful Login to Secrets Endpoint!
 ```

 {{<info>}}
 **Kubernetes users:** This is not required if you are using _Portworx 2.0_ and higher on _Kubernetes_ and you have `-secret_type` as k8s in Daemonset
 {{</info>}}

* Now, run the backup command:

 ```text
 pxctl cloudsnap backup NewVol
 ```

 ```output
 Cloudsnap backup started successfully with id: 3f4f0a67-e12a-4d35-81ad-985657757352
 ```

 {{<info>}}
 Note that, in this particular example, since only one credential is configured, there is no need to specify the credentials on the command line.
 {{</info>}}

* While _PX_ is working, let's check the progress of our backups:

 ```text
 pxctl cloudsnap status
 ```

 ```output
 NAME					SOURCEVOLUME									STATE		NODE		BYTES-PROCESSED	TIME-ELAPSED	COMPLETED

 ```

 You could also check the status of a particular job, by passing the `task-id` returned upon the successful execution of the `pxctl cloudsnap backup` command:

 ```text
 pxctl cloudsnap status -n 3f4f0a67-e12a-4d35-81ad-985657757352
 ```

 ```output
 NAME					SOURCEVOLUME									STATE		NODE		BYTES-PROCESSED	TIME-ELAPSED	COMPLETED

 ```

 Once the volume is backed up to the cloud successfully, listing the remote cloudsnaps will display the backup that has just been completed.

* List the backups in cloud

 ```text
 pxctl cloudsnap list

### Perform cloud backup of a group of volumes

_Portworx_ 2.0.3 and higher supports backing up multiple volumes to cloud at the same consistency point. To see the available command line options, run:

```text
pxctl cloudsnap backup-group --help
```

```output
Backup a group of snapshot for a given group id or labels to cloud

Usage:
  pxctl cloudsnap backup-group [flags]

Aliases:
  backup-group, bg

Flags:
      --full                Force a full backup
      --group string        group id
      --cred-id string      Cloud credentials ID to be used for the backup
      --label pairs         list of comma-separated name=value pairs
  -v, --volume_ids string   list of comma-separated volume IDs
  -h, --help                help for backup-group

Global Flags:
      --ca string        path to root certificate for ssl usage
      --cert string      path to client certificate for ssl usage
      --color            output with color coding
      --config string    config file (default is $HOME/.pxctl.yaml)
      --context string   context name that overrides the current auth context
  -j, --json             output in json
      --key string       path to client key for ssl usage
      --raw              raw CLI output for instrumentation
      --ssl              ssl enabled for portworx
```

#### Examples

The below command  takes a group cloud backup of volumes _vol1_ and _vol2_:

```text
pxctl cloudsnap backup-group  -v vol1,vol2
```

```output
Group Cloudsnap backup started successfully with groupID:a1c8ba67-90e1-4c58-acbe-8eaca61a02ae
```

Then, you can grab the `groupID` from above and use it to check the status of the group cloud snapshot. The following command will show status of each cloud snapshot in the group:

```text
pxctl cs status -n a1c8ba67-90e1-4c58-acbe-8eaca61a02ae
```

```output

```

You can also take a group cloud backup by selecting the volumes based on their labels. In the example below, we have 2 volumes with the label *app=mysql*:

```text
 pxctl volume list -l app=mysql
```

```output
ID                      NAME    SIZE    HA      SHARED  ENCRYPTED       IO_PRIORITY     STATUS          SNAP-ENABLED

```

To back them up as a group to the cloud backup, run the following:

```text
pxctl cloudsnap backup-group --label app=mysql
```

```output
Group Cloudsnap backup started successfully with groupID:3b1de846-1078-40e6-ac1a-2e66ef3986d1
```

### Extent based cloudsnaps

{{<info>}}This feature is not available in versions prior to 2.0.{{</info>}}

With PX-Enterprise 2.0, Portworx has enhanced the way cloud backups are done. Now, users can resume interrupted backups or restores.

For example, if the node performing backups or restores restarts, the backup/restore will resume once that node becomes operational.

This feature is also available for cloud backups of aggregated volumes. Here are a few points to consider in this regard:

* For aggregated volumes, aggregated parts are backed up/restored sequentially.

* Each aggregated part is backed up/restored on one of the nodes where the replica of that aggregated part is provisioned.

* If not enough nodes are available to create the required aggregation level, aggregated volumes are restored to a non-aggregated volume(i.e. `aggregation=1`).

### Restore from a cloud backup

Use `pxctl cloudsnap restore` to restore from a cloud backup. To see the available command options and arguments, run the following:

```text
pxctl cloudsnap restore --help
```

```output
Restore volume to a cloud snapshot

Usage:
  pxctl cloudsnap restore [flags]

Aliases:
  restore, r

Flags:
  -v, --volume string    Volume name to be created for restore
  -s, --snap string      Cloud-snap id to restore
  -n, --node string      Optional node ID for provisioning restore volume storage
      --cred-id string   Cloud credentials ID to be used for the restore
  -h, --help             help for restore

Global Flags:
      --ca string        path to root certificate for ssl usage
      --cert string      path to client certificate for ssl usage
      --color            output with color coding
      --config string    config file (default is $HOME/.pxctl.yaml)
      --context string   context name that overrides the current auth context
  -j, --json             output in json
      --key string       path to client key for ssl usage
      --raw              raw CLI output for instrumentation
      --ssl              ssl enabled for portworx
```

This command is used to restore a successful backup from the cloud. It requires the cloudsnap ID and the credentials for the cloud storage provider or the object storage. Restore happens on any node where storage can be provisioned.

You can restore a backup of a _PX_ to one of your _PX_ volumes in the cluster. Once restored, the volume inherits the attributes from the backup (e.g.: file system, size and block size). The replication level of the restored volume defaults to 1, irrespective of the replication level of the volume that was backed up. Users can increase the replication factor once the restore is complete on the restored volume.

To restore a backup from cloud, use:

```text
pxctl cloudsnap restore --snap cs30/669945798649540757-864783518531595119 --cred-id 82998914-5245-4739-a218-3b0b06160332
```

```output
Cloudsnap restore started successfully on volume: 104172750626071399 with task name:59c4cfd5-4160-45db-b326-f37b327d9225
```

Once a restore gets started, `pxctl` shows the id of the volume created to restore the cloud snap together with the task-id. The latter can be used to check the job's status.

If the command fails, it shows the reason why it failed.

Note that the restored volume will not be attached or mounted automatically.

{{<info>}}
Note: With PX-Enterprise 2.1.0, users can choose to do optimized restores. This is useful for worflows that involves frequent restores from a different cluster. With optimized restores enabled, every successful restore creates a snapshot that will be used for next incremental restore of the same volume. Hence for an incremental restore, only the last incremental backup will downloaded instead of downloading all the dependent backups. However this works, only if dependent backups were downloaded previously. Currently this requires runtime option `optimized_restore=1` to be set while starting portworx container.

### List cloud backups

Use `pxctl cloudsnap list` to list your cloud backups.

```text
pxctl cloudsnap list

{{<info>}}
**Note:** This command assumes that all your credentials are properly set up. If that is not the case, the cloud backups won't show up.
{{</info>}}

Next, let's pick one of these backups and have `pxctl` restore it:

```text
pxctl cloudsnap restore -s 2e4d4b67-95d7-481e-aec5-14223ac55170/56706279008755778-725134927222077463
```

```output
Cloudsnap restore started successfully on volume: 104172750626071399 with task name:59c4cfd5-4160-45db-b326-f37b327d9225
```

While the job is running, `pxctl cloudsnap status` gives the status of the restore process:

```text
pxctl cloudsnap status
```

```output

### Deleting a Cloud Backup

{{<info>}}
This feature is only supported starting with _PX_ version 1.4 or later.
{{</info>}}

To delete a cloud backup, run:

```text
pxctl cloudsnap delete
```

The command will flag a cloudsnap for deletion and a job will take care of deleting objects associated with these backups from the objectstore.

Only cloudsnaps which do not have any dependant cloudsnaps (ie incrementals) can be deleted. If there are dependent cloudsnaps then the command will throw an error and will show the list of cloudsnaps that need to be deleted first.

{{<info>}}
For _PX_ versions above and including 2.1, delete requests are queued and processed in the background. Since querying cloud to figure out dependent backups can take a while, user requests to delete the backups are added to a queue and an immediate response is returned to the user. If a cloud backup could not be deleted because of other dependent backups, an alert is logged and this will be deleted when all other dependent backups are deleted by the user.
{{</info>}}

As an example, to delete the backup `pqr9-cl1/538316104266867971-807625803401928868`, you could run the following:

```text
pxctl cloudsnap delete --snap pqr9-cl1/538316104266867971-807625803401928868
```

```output
Cloudsnap deleted successfully
pxctl cloudsnap list

### Cloud backup schedules

Cloud backup schedules allow backups to be uploaded to cloud at periodic intervals of time. These schedules can be managed through `pxctl`.

To view the list of available commands and flags, use:

```text
pxctl cloudsnap schedules --help
```

```output
Manage schedules for cloud-snaps

Usage:
  pxctl cloudsnap schedules [flags]
  pxctl cloudsnap schedules [command]

Aliases:
  schedules, sched

Available Commands:
  create       Create a cloud-snap schedule
  delete       Delete a cloud-snap schedule
  list         List the configured cloud-snap schedules

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for schedules

Global Flags:
      --ca string        path to root certificate for ssl usage
      --cert string      path to client certificate for ssl usage
      --color            output with color coding
      --config string    config file (default is $HOME/.pxctl.yaml)
      --context string   context name that overrides the current auth context
  -j, --json             output in json
      --key string       path to client key for ssl usage
      --raw              raw CLI output for instrumentation
      --ssl              ssl enabled for portworx

Use "pxctl cloudsnap schedules [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

#### Creating a cloud backup schedule

Cloud backup schedules can be created using `pxctl cloudsnap schedules create`. To get help on using this command, run:

```text
pxctl cloudsnap schedules create  --help
```

```output
Create a cloud-snap schedule

Usage:
  pxctl cloudsnap schedules create [flags]

Aliases:
  create, c

Flags:
  -f, --full              Force scheduled backups to be full always
  -v, --volume string     Volume ID to set the cloud-snap schedule
  -p, --periodic string   Cloudsnap interval in minutes (default "0")
      --cred-id string    Cloud credentials ID to be used for the backup
  -x, --max uint          Maximum number of cloud snaps to maintain, default 7 (default 7)
  -d, --daily strings     Daily snapshot at specified hh:mm (UTC)
  -w, --weekly strings    Weekly snapshot at specified weekday@hh:mm (UTC)
  -m, --monthly strings   Monthly snapshot at specified day@hh:mm (UTC)
  -h, --help              help for create

Global Flags:
      --ca string        path to root certificate for ssl usage
      --cert string      path to client certificate for ssl usage
      --color            output with color coding
      --config string    config file (default is $HOME/.pxctl.yaml)
      --context string   context name that overrides the current auth context
  -j, --json             output in json
      --key string       path to client key for ssl usage
      --raw              raw CLI output for instrumentation
      --ssl              ssl enabled for portworx
```

Let's look at a simple example:

```text
 pxctl cloudsnap schedules create testVol --daily 21:00 --max 15 --cred-id cc84ef11-6d94-4c20-b4b9-01615119a442
 ```

```output
 Cloudsnap schedule created successfully
```

The above command creates a daily schedule that retains a maximum of 15 backups in the cloud. Use the `--max` parameter to indicate the number of backups you want to retain in the cloud. Then, the most recent `--max` number of backups are retained and older backups are deleted periodically.

{{<info>}}
Note that, while listing cloud backups, you may see more than the `--max` number of backups. Due to the incremental nature of backups, we may need to retain more than `--max` backups in order to allow `--max` backups to be restored at any given time.
{{</info>}}

#### Listing Cloud Backup Schedules
You can list the backup schedules that are currently configured using the following command:

```text
pxctl cloudsnap schedules list
```

```output
UUID						VOLUMEID			MAX-BACKUPS		FULL		SCHEDULE(UTC)
078557a3-26c7-49b1-9822-34e6f816c2d1		648038464574631167		15			false		daily @21:00
```


#### Deleting a Cloud Backup Schedule
Run the following to delete a backup schedule:

```text
pxctl cloudsnap schedules  delete --uuid 078557a3-26c7-49b1-9822-34e6f816c2d1
```

```output
Cloudsnap schedule deleted successfully
```
