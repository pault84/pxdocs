### DAY 1 Operations {#day-1-operations}

#### Initial Software Setup for Production {#initial-software-setup-for-production}

* Follow the instructions in the [k8s install](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes) page in the docs.
* Ensure all nodes in the cluster have NTP running and the times are synchronized across all the nodes that will form the Portworx cluster
* All nodes in the cluster should have achieved quorum and `pxctl status` should display the cluster as `operational`
* etcd - Setup etcd as a 3-node etcd cluster _outside_ the container orchestrator to ensure maximum stability. Refer to the following [page](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/operate-and-maintain-on-kubernetes/etcd) on how to install etcd and also configure it for maximum stability.

#### Configuring the Server or the Compute Infrastructure {#configuring-the-server-or-the-compute-infrastructure}

* Check and ensure a _minimum_ 2 cores and 4GB of RAM are allocated for Portworx.
* The base operating system of the server supports linux kernel 3.10+ . Newer 4.x linux kernels have many performance and stability related fixes and is recommended.

```text
uname -r
```

```output
3.10.0-327.22.2.el7.x86_64
```

#### Configuring the Networking Infrastructure {#configuring-the-networking-infrastructure}

* Make sure the following ports are open in all the servers. 9001-9022
* Configure separate networks for Data and Management networks to isolate the traffic
  * Data network is specified giving the ‘-d’ switch and Management networks with the ‘-m’ switch. Refer to [scheduler guides](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes) for specifics to enable it in your scheduler.
  * With multiple NICs, create a bonded ethernet port for data interface for improved availability and performance.

#### Configuring and Provisioning Underlying Storage {#configuring-and-provisioning-underlying-storage}

**Selecting drives for an installation**

* Storage can be provided to Portworx explicitly by passing in a list of block devices. `lsblk -a` will display a list of devices on the system. This is accomplished by the ‘-s’ flag as a runtime parameter. It can also be provided implicity by passing in the ‘-a’ flag. In this mode, Portworx will pick up all the available drives that are not in use. When combined with ‘-f’, Portworx will pick up drives even if they have a filesystem on them \(mounted drives are still excluded\). Note that not all nodes need to contribute storage; a node can operate in the storageless mode with the ‘-z’ switch.

This can be specificed in the args section of the px-spec.yaml used for installing PX as a daemonset.

```text
          args:
            ["-k", "etcd://example.etcd.server:2379", "-d", "eth0", "-m", "eth1",  "-c", "testcluster", "-a", "-f",
             "-x", "kubernetes"]
```

* HW RAID - If there are a large number of drives in a server and drive failure tolerance is required per server, enable HW RAID \(if available\) and give the block device from a HW RAID volume for Portworx to manage.
* PX classifies drive media into different performance levels and groups them in separate pools for volume data. These levels are called `io_priority` \(or `priority_io` in kubernetes px spec\) and they offer the levels `high`, `medium` and `low`
* The `priority_io` of a pool is determined automatically by PX. If the intention is to run low latency transactional workloads like databases on PX, then Portworx recommends having NVMe or other SAS/SATA SSDs in the system. Pool priority can be managed as documented [here](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/operate-and-maintain-on-kubernetes/maintenance-mode)

**Working with drives with AWS Auto scaling group**

Portworx supports automatic management of EBS volumes. If you are using AWS ASG to manage PX nodes,then you should to use the ASG [feature](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/cloud/aws/aws-asg)

#### PX Node Topology {#px-node-topology}

PX replicated volumes distributes data across failure domains. For on-premise installations, this ensures that a power failure to a rack does not result in data unavailability. For cloud deployments this ensures data availability across zones.

#### Topology in cloud environments {#topology-in-cloud-environments}

PX auto-detects availabilty zones and regions and provisions replicas across different zones. For e.g., see below for the partial output of `pxctl status`

```text
pxctl status
```

```output
Status: PX is operational
License: Trial (expires in 23 days)
Node ID: a17f382d-b2ef-41b8-81fc-d9b86d56b5d1
IP: 172.31.51.89
Local Storage Pool: 2 pools
POOL	IO_PRIORITY	RAID_LEVEL	USABLE	USED	STATUS	ZONE	REGION
0	LOW		raid0		64 GiB	1.1 GiB	Online	b	us-east-1
1	LOW		raid0		128 GiB	65 GiB	Online	b	us-east-1
...
...
```

This node is in us-east-1. If PX is started in other zones, then when a volume with greater than 1 replication factor is created, it will have the replicas automatically created in other nodes in other zones.

#### Topology in on-premise deployments: {#topology-in-on-premise-deployments}

Failure domains in terms of RACK information can be passed in as described [here](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/operate-and-maintain-on-kubernetes/cluster-topology)

#### Volume Management Best Practices {#volume-management-best-practices}

* Volumes - Portworx volumes are thinly provisioned by default. Make sure to monitor for capacity threshold alerts. Monitor for for Volume Space Low alerts

  ```
  30|VolumeSpaceLow|ALARM|VOLUME|Triggered when the free space available in a volume goes below a threshold.
  ```

* For applications needing node level availability and read parallelism across nodes, it is recommended to set the volumes with replication factor 2 or replication factor 3

  Following storeclass shows how to create a SC for a PVC with replication factor of 3.

  ```text
   kind: StorageClass
   apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
   metadata:
   name: portworx-sc
   provisioner: kubernetes.io/portworx-volume
   parameters:
   repl: "3"
  ```

* PX makes best effort to distribute volumes evenly across all nodes and based on the `iopriority` that is requested. When PX cannot find the appropriate media type that is requested to create a given `iopriority` type, it will attempt to create the volume with the next available `iopriority` level.

```text
 kind: StorageClass
 apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
 metadata:
   name: portworx-sc
 provisioner: kubernetes.io/portworx-volume
 parameters:
   repl: "3"
   priority_io: "high"
```

* Volumes can be created in different availability zones by using the `--zones` option in the `pxctl volume create` command

For e.g., for PX cluster running on AWS,

```text
 kind: StorageClass
 apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
 metadata:
   name: portworx-sc
 provisioner: kubernetes.io/portworx-volume
 parameters:
   repl: "3"
   priority_io: "high"
   zones: "us-east-1a"
```

* Volumes can be created in different racks using `--racks` option and passing the rack labels when creating the volume

```text
 kind: StorageClass
 apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
 metadata:
   name: portworx-sc
 provisioner: kubernetes.io/portworx-volume
 parameters:
   repl: "3"
   priority_io: "high"
   racks: "rack1"
```

* If the volumes need to be protected against accidental deletes because of background garbage collecting scripts, then the volumes need to enabled with `--sticky` flag

```text
 kind: StorageClass
 apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
 metadata:
   name: portworx-sc
 provisioner: kubernetes.io/portworx-volume
 parameters:
   repl: "3"
   priority_io: "high"
   racks: "rack1"
   sticky: "true"
```

* For applications that require shared access from multiple containers running in different hosts, Portworx recommends running shared volumes. Shared volumes can be configured as follows by adding `shared: "true"` to the storage class:

```text
 kind: StorageClass
 apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
 metadata:
   name: portworx-sc
 provisioner: kubernetes.io/portworx-volume
 parameters:
   repl: "3"
   priority_io: "high"
   racks: "rack1"
   shared: "true"
```

This [page](/concepts) gives more details on different volume types, how to create them and update the configuration for the volumes

* In order to ensure hyper-convergence, ensure you have Stork installed and running in the cluster. See the install instructions in the previous section

#### Data Protection for Containers {#data-protection-for-containers}

* Snapshots - Follow DR best practices and ensure volume snapshots are scheduled for instantaneous recovery in the case of app failures.
* Portworx support 64 snapshots per volume.
* Refer to this [document](/reference/cli/snapshots) for a brief overview on how to manage snapshots via `pxctl`. In Kubernetes, most snapshot functionality can be handled via kubernetes command line.
* Periodic scheduled snapshots can be setup by defining the `snap_interval` in the Portworx StorageClass. An example is shown below.

```text
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
  metadata:
    name: portworx-repl-1-snap-internal
provisioner: kubernetes.io/portworx-volume
parameters:
  repl: "1"
  snap_interval: "240"
```

* You can use annotations in Kubernetes to perform on-demand snapshot operations from within Kubernetes.

Portworx uses a special annotation `px/snapshot-source-pvc` which can be used to identify the name of the source PVC whose snapshot needs to be taken.

```text
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  namespace: prod
  name: ns.prod-name.px-snap-1
  annotations:
    volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: px-sc
    px/snapshot-source-pvc: px-vol-1
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 6Gi
```

Note the format of the `name` field - `ns.<namespace_of_source_pvc>-name.<name_of_the_snapshot>`. The above example takes a snapshot with the name “px-snap-1” of the source PVC “px-vol-1” in the “prod” namespace.

{{<info>}}
**Note:**
Annotations support is available from PX Version 1.2.11.6
{{</info>}}

For using annotations Portworx daemon set requires extra permissions to read annotations from PVC object. Make sure your ClusterRole has the following section

```text
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["persistentvolumeclaims"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

You can run the following command to edit your existing Portworx ClusterRole

```text
kubectl edit clusterrole node-get-put-list-role
```

* Refer to the [Snapshots document](/reference/cli/snapshots) in the Kubernetes section of the docs for more up to date information on snapshots.
* If you have installed Stork, the snapshot operations can be executed via Stork. Follow the [link](https://github.com/libopenstorage/stork/tree/master#creating-snapshots) to see how snapshots can be done with Stork.
* For DR, It is recommended to setup cloudsnaps as well which is covered in detail in the Day 3 - Cloudsnaps section


#### Alerts and Monitoring for Production {#alerts-and-monitoring-for-production}

Portworx recommends setting up monitoring with Prometheus and AlertsManager to ensure monitoring of the data services infrastructure for your containers

{{<info>}}
**Note:**
Please remember to setup cadvisor and nodexporter properly so they mount the ‘/’ partition as ro:slave. Refer to this [link](/install-with-other/operate-and-maintain/monitoring) for more information
{{</info>}}

While Prometheus can be deployed as a container within the container orchestrator, many of Portworx’s production customers deploy Prometheus in a separate cluster that is dedicated for managing and monitoring their large scale container orchestrator infrastructure.

* Here is how Prometheus can be setup to monitor Portworx [Prometheus] (/install-with-other/operate-and-maintain/monitoring/prometheus)
* Configure Grafana via this [template](/install-with-other/operate-and-maintain/monitoring/grafana)
* Here is how Alerts Manager can be configured for looking for alerts with [Alerts Manager](/install-with-other/operate-and-maintain/monitoring/alerting)
* List of Portworx Alerts are documented [here](/install-with-other/operate-and-maintain/monitoring/portworx-alerts)


### Day 2 Operations {#day-2-operations}

#### Hung Node Recovery {#hung-node-recovery}

* A PX node may hang or appeart to hang because of any of the following reasons
  * Underlying media being too slow to respond and thus PX trying to error recovery of the media
  * Kernel hangs or panics that are impacting overall operations of the system
  * Other applications that are not properly constrainted putting heavy memory pressure on the system
  * Applications consuming a lot of CPU that are not properly constrained
* Docker Daemon issues where Docker itself has hung and thus resulting on all other containers not responding properly
* Running PX as a OCI container greatly alleviates any issues introduced by Docker Daemon hanging or not being responsive as PX runs as a OCI container and not as a docker container thus eliminating the docker dependency
* If PX appears to not respond, a restart of the PX OCI container via `systemctl` would help.
* Any PX restart within 10 mins will ensure that applications continue to run without experiencing volume unmounts/outage

#### Stuck Volume Detection and Resolution {#stuck-volume-detection-and-resolution}

* With K8s, it is possible that even after the application container terminates, a volume is left attached. This volume is still available for use in any other node. PX makes sure that if a a volume is not in use by an application, it can be attached to any other node in the system
* With this attach operation, the PX will automatically manage the volume attach status with no user intervention required and continue to serve the volume I/Os even a container attaches to the same volume from a different node.

#### Scaling out a cluster nodes in the Cloud and On-Prem {#scaling-out-a-cluster-nodes-in-the-cloud-and-on-prem}

**Scaling out a cluster in cloud**

* The best way to scale a cluster is via ASG integration on AWS
* This feature is called Stateful Autoscaling and is described [here](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/cloud/aws/aws-asg)
  * Perform sizing of your data needs and determine the amount and type of storage \(EBS volumes\) needed per ecs instance.
  * Create EBS volume [templates](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/cloud/aws/aws-asg) to match the number of EBS volumes needed per EC2 instance
  * Create a [Stateful AMI](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/cloud/aws/aws-asg) to associate with your auto-scaling group
  * Once everything is setup as described in the steps above, then the cluster can be scaled up and down via ASG. Portworx will automatically manage the EBS volume creation and preserve the volumes across the cluster scaling up and down. This [page](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/cloud/aws/aws-asg) desribes how PX handles the volume management in a auto-scaling cluster.

**Scaling out a cluster on-prem**

* The best way to scale the cluster on-prem is by having the new nodes join the existing cluster. This [page](/install-with-other/operate-and-maintain/scaling/scale-out) shows how to scale up a existing cluster by adding more nodes.
* In Kubernetes, PX is deployed as a Daemonset. This enables PX to automatically scale as the cluster scales. So there is no specific action needed from the user to scale PX along with the cluster scaling

#### Cluster Capacity Expansion {#cluster-capacity-expansion}

* Cluster storage capacity can be expanded by adding more drives each node.
* Drives with similar capacity \(within 1GB capacity difference\) will be grouped together as a same pool
* Drives can be added per node and PX will add that to the closest pool size by drive size.
* Before adding drives to the node, the node will need to be taken into maintenance mode
* Ensure the volumes in the node have replicas in other nodes
  * If the volumes have replication factor of 1, increase the [replication factor](/reference/cli/updating-volumes)
  * Ensure the services are failed over to a different node when the node is taken into maintenance mode.
* Follow the instructions in this [page](/install-with-other/operate-and-maintain/scaling/scale-up) to add storage each node.

#### Server and Networking Replacements and Upgrades {#server-and-networking-replacements-and-upgrades}

* Servers running PX can be replaced by performing decommissioning of the server to safely remove them from the cluster
* Ensure that all the volumes in the cluster are replicated before decommissioning the node so that the data is still available for the containers mounting the volumes after the node is decommisioned
* Delete PX from the node by setting the PX/Enabled=remove [label](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/operate-and-maintain-on-kubernetes)
* Use `pxctl cluster delete` command to manually remove the node from the cluster
* Follow the instructions in this page to [delete](/install-with-other/operate-and-maintain/scaling/scale-down) nodes in the cluster
* Once the node is decommissioned, components like network adapters, storage adapters that need to be replaced can be replaced
* The server can be replaced as well
* Once the replacement is done, the node can be joined back to the cluster by going through the steps described in the scaling-out the cluster section

#### Software Upgrades {#software-upgrades}

**Portworx Upgrades**

* Work with Portworx Support before planning major upgrades
* Ensure all volumes have up-to-date [snapshots](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/storage-operations/create-snapshots)
* Ensure all volumes have up-to-date [cloudsnaps](/reference/cli/cloud-snaps)
* Refer to [Upgrade Portworx on Kubernetes](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/operate-and-maintain-on-kubernetes/upgrade)

**Kubernetes Upgrades**

* Work with Portworx Support before planning major upgrades. Ensure all volumes have the latest snapshots before performing upgrade
* Ensure there are [cloudsnaps](/reference/cli/cloud-snaps) that are taken.
* After the migration, relaunch PX and ensure that the entire cluster is online by running `pxctl status`

**OS upgrades and Docker Upgrades .**

* Work with Portworx Support before planning major upgrades. Ensure all volumes have the latest snapshots before performing upgrade
* Ensure kernel-devel packages are installed after a OS migration
* If PX is run as a OCI container, Docker Upgrades and Restarts do not impact PX runtime. So recommend running PX as a OCI container

### Day 3 Operations {#day-3-operations}

#### Handling Lost or Stale Nodes on the Cloud and On-Prem {#handling-lost-or-stale-nodes-on-the-cloud-and-on-prem}

* Lost or Stale Nodes can be removed from the PX cluster for force-decommissioning the node from the cluster
* The command used to remove a node is `pxctl cluster delete -f`
* For e.g., if a specific node is offline but it no longer exists, use \` pxctl cluster delete -f node-id\` to remove the node from the cluster

#### Volume Data Recovery {#volume-data-recovery}

#### Disaster Recovery with Cloudsnaps {#disaster-recovery-with-cloudsnaps}

* It is recommended to setup cloudsnaps for volume backup and recovery to handle DR scenarios
* Cloudsnaps are also good way to perform cluster to cluster data migration
* Cloudsnaps can work with Amazon S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage or any S3 compatible object store
* Cloudsnaps stores the volume snaps in the cloud and on import, can roll up all the snaps and import a point-in-time copy of the volume into the cluster
* It is recommended to take atleast one cloudsnap a day for each volume in production in the cluster
* Cloudsnaps can be scheduled via the Portworx CLI for hourly, daily, weekly or monthly snaps.
* Cloudsnaps can also be scheduled to happen at a particular time. It is recommended to schedule cloudsnaps at a time when the application data traffic is light to ensure faster back ups.
* Follow [DR best practices](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/operate-and-maintain-on-kubernetes/dr-best-practices) and setup a periodic cloudsnaps so in case of a disaster, Portworx volumes can be restored from an offsite backup

#### Drive Replacements {#drive-replacements}

* Any drive in a given node can be replaced by another drive in the same node
* In order to perform a drive replacement, the PX node must be put into `maintenance mode`

**Step 1: Enter Maintenance mode**

```text
pxctl service  maintenance --enter
```

```output
This is a disruptive operation, PX will restart in maintenance mode.
Are you sure you want to proceed ? (Y/N): y

PX is not running on this host.
```

**Step 2: Replace old drive with a new drive**

Ensure the replacement drive is already available in the system.

For e.g., Replace drive /dev/sde with /dev/sdc

```text
pxctl service drive replace --source /dev/sde --target /dev/sdc --operation start
```

```output
"Replace operation is in progress"
```

Check the replace status

```text
pxctl service drive replace --source /dev/sde --target /dev/sdc --operation status
```

```output
"Started on 16.Dec 22:17:06, finished on 16.Dec 22:17:06, 0 write errs, 0 uncorr. read errs\n"
```

**Step 3: Exit Maintenance mode**

```text
pxctl service  maintenance --exit
```

```output
PX is now operational
```

**Step 4: Check if the drive has been successfully replaced**

```text
pxctl service drive show
```

```output
PX drive configuration:
Pool ID: 0
	IO_Priority: LOW
	Size: 15 TiB
	Status: Online
	Has meta data: No
	Drives:
	1: /dev/sdc, 3.0 GiB allocated of 7.3 TiB, Online
	2: /dev/sdb, 0 B allocated of 7.3 TiB, Online
Pool ID: 1
	IO_Priority: HIGH
	Size: 1.7 TiB
	Status: Online
	Has meta data: Yes
	Drives:
	1: /dev/sdj, 1.0 GiB allocated of 1.7 TiB, Online
```

* If there is no spare drive available in the system, then the following steps need to be performed
  * Decommission the PX node \(Refer to `pxctl cluster delete`\)
  * Ensure all volumes have replicas in other nodes if you still need to access the data
  * Replace the bad drive\(s\) with new drive\(s\)
  * Add the node to the cluster as a new node \(refer to [adding cluster nodes](/install-with-other/operate-and-maintain/scaling/scale-out)\)
  * Ensure the cluster is operational and the new node has been added to the cluster via `pxctl cluster status` and `pxctl cluster list`
