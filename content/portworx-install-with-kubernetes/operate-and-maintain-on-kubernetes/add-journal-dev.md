## Adding Journal Device to an existing node.

This section illustrates how to add a journal device to an existing node.

### 1. Enter maintenance mode

In order to add journal device to a node, the node must be put in maintenance mode:

```text
pxctl service maintenance --enter
```

```output
This is a disruptive operation, PX will restart in maintenance mode.
Are you sure you want to proceed ? (Y/N): Y
```

Check if the node is in maintenance mode:

```text
pxctl status
```

```output
PX is in maintenance mode.  Use the service mode option to exit maintenance mode.

```

### 2. Add the journal device to the node

A journal device is recommended to be an SSD/NVME:

```text
pxctl service drive add -d /dev/nvme01 --journal
```

```output
Successfully added journal device /dev/nvme010p1
```

{{<info>}}
The journal device is expected to not have any filesystem on it, This can be verified by running `blkid /dev/nvme01`. If it has a filesystem on it and you still want to use it as a journal device, the filesystem should be removed by running `wipefs -a /dev/nvme01`.

### 3. Exit maintenance mode

```text
pxctl service maintenance --exit
```
